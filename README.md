# DoomGAN
Procedurally Generate DOOM(1993) levels using Deep Neural Networks

The goal of this project is to harness the power of DNN to automate the generation of various aspects of level design by training the network on a subset of DOOM levels scraped from the internet that can be bought together to generate levels for the game DOOM. 

# Requirements
This project is made using python v3.9 and requires tensorflow related application for applying GPU hardware to boost the computational
It includes the installation Cuda v11.2 and Cudnn v8.7 with tensorflow-gpu instead of native tensorflow
